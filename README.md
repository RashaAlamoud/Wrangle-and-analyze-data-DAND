Wrangle and Analyze Data - WeRateDogs twitter account

# Project Overview

## Introduction 

The dataset that I will be wrangling ,analyzing and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

## Installing


```python
•Install Jupyter Notebook 

•Require the following libraries installed:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

requests

tweepy

json
```

## Data Gathering 

Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled Wrangle_act.ipynb.

1.The WeRateDogs Twitter archive:
This file called twitter_archive_enhanced.csv.

2.The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file called image_predictions.tsv.

3.Each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file.

## Data Assessing

At least eight (8) data quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues are detected, and include the issues to clean to satisfy the Project Motivation. Each issue is documented in one to a few sentences each.

## Data Cleaning

-The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented

-Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.

-All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.

-A tidy master dataset with all pieces of gathered data is created.

## Storing and Acting on Wrangled Data 

-Save master dataset to a CSV file.

-The master dataset is analyzed using pandas in the Jupyter Notebook and at least three (3) separate insights are produced.

-At least one (1) labeled visualization is produced in the Jupyter Notebook using Python’s plotting libraries.
